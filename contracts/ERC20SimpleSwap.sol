/**
@title Chequebook contract without waivers
@author The Swarm Authors
@notice The chequebook contract allows the issuer of the chequebook to send cheques to an unlimited amount of counterparties.
Furthermore, solvency can be guaranteed via hardDeposits
@dev as an issuer, no cheques should be send if the cumulative worth of a cheques send is above the cumulative worth of all deposits
as a beneficiary, we should always take into account the possibility that a cheque bounces (when no hardDeposits are assigned)
